# Let's Learn Graph Neural Networks (GNN)! [PyTorch Geometric]
"Let's Learn Graph Neural Networks!" is an introductory course to Graph Neural Networks (GNN). GNN is a neural network that incorporates deep learning into the data structure called "graph," composed of nodes and edges.

GNN has been applied in various fields such as recommendation systems, analysis of human relationships, prediction in transportation and logistics, and estimation of physical properties of compounds.
